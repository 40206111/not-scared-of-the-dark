# Not Scared of the Dark
You own the Nightmare Tower, meaning you are the most successful monster in Monsterville! Great, good job. However lots of other monsters want the tower, and the title that comes with it. How do they get it? By killing you of course. Hire your most terrifying customers to scare off any threats to the tower, or face your doom.
